# TEd - Tiny Editor

Just a little experiment of mine.

# Usage

It uses most of the vi-keybindings but not all of them:

```
i - insertmode
I - begin of line and insert
A - append end of line
a - append
l - move right
h - move left
j - move down
k - move up
dd - delete line
x - delete character
w - write file (not like in vi)
q - quit (not like in vi)
```

In further versions of TEd it will be more compatible with vi and the commands
which differ will bi corrected.
